<!--[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/epics-modules/motor.png)](https://travis-ci.org/epics-modules/motor)-->

This module contains motor support for the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS).

The core motor functionality resides in this respository.  Starting with R7-0 the drivers have been moved from motor to standalone github repositories, which have been added to motor as submodules.  The driver repositories can be found here: https://github.com/epics-motor

## Getting started

### Updating clones created before 2019-04-02
Use the following procedure to update clones that were created before the beginning of the motor split:
```bash
$ cd motor
$ make distclean
$ git fetch origin
$ git status
<behind by many commits and can be fast-forwarded>
$ git stash
$ git rebase origin/master
$ git stash apply
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```
Failure to 'make distclean' before rebasing will result in many driver source directories in motorApp with "O.*" directories that need to be removed manually.

### Cloning motor with support for all motor controllers
The following command results in a motor directory that contains all of the driver submodules:
```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/epics-modules/motor.git
```

### Cloning motor with support for a single motor controller
The following procedure allows only required drivers to be built, which can significantly reduce build times:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/epics-modules/motor.git
$ cd motor
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update modules/motorMotorSim
```
